            <h1>Our philosophy</h1>
            <p>These are the philosophies which our software follows... and me just ranting in general.</p>
        	<h2>Defining Bloatware</h2>
            <p>Bloatware is a piece of pre-installed non-crucial system software and/or something a user will not 100% always need. AI integration into the operating system for example, is bloatware.</p>
            <h2>The beauty of open-source</h2>
            <p>Open-source isn't just a form of software, it's a form of honesty. If one were to inject malware into open-source code, it would be noticed sooner rather than later.</p>
            <h2>We need more apps on Linux, not distros.</h2>
            <p>Ever since the inception of remix tools like Remastersys and Refracta people have been making distros that barely qualify as a distro and are nothing but Ubuntu with shiny themes. Along this road, the whole point of helping those move to Linux was shifted from app compatibilty/alternatives to thinking that more distros would help the user. However, more distros infact harm new users when it comes to choosing. </p>
            <h2>The unfortunate state of company-maintained open-source software.</h2>
            <p>Several previously "good" Linux distros like Ubuntu and RedHat have lately lost credibility due to poor corporate decisions by their parent companies (Canonical and IBM respectively). Ever since v16.04, Ubuntu has slowly deteriorated their roots. Snaps being forced onto it's users, the Amazon shortcut in the desktop that was collecting telemetry, and dropping all projects are but a few of the issues plaguing users. Not just users are affected, but maintainers too. The Snap backend is closed-source unlike most package manager backends meaning several repository maintainers can't make mirrors or repos. </p>

            <p>Well, thats my rant!</p>
